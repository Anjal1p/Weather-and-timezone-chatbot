# Weather-and-timezone-chatbot
A chatbot that calls a weather API and a timezone API and interacts with the user getting data from the APIs

This program uses APIs and the freenode.net webchat services to implement a chatbot. 
This chatbot uses two main APIS: 
1. weather api
2. TimeZonedb api. 

It enables other users to join the chat server and the channel for this program. The two main things the chat bots returns are the weather and the local time and time zone. 

To connect to the channel:
1. Go to webchat.freenode.net
2. Fill in a nickname and the desired channel (in this case, #pircbot)
3. If the nickname is not registered, go ahead and do so. For additional help on this step use the following link: https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration

4. Once you have joined the channel, you are connected to the Chatbot through the channel.
